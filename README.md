# Vat monitor (v3)

A simple app to check if a "NIP" (Polish tax ID number) is a VAT payer (sometimes you need to do that ;) )

Of course there are better ways to do it than writing your own app, but it's way more fun to actually write the app :D

## Still TODO

- nice UI
- Some history view
- Periodical check in background
- some terms & conditions maybe?
